      <h1> Arch Linux Installation Guide </h1>
       <h2> About getting into Arch Linux </h2>
      <p> 
        I will assume you are knowledgable of linux. I would recommend you have some experience with Ubuntu or Manjaro linux distributions. 
        Arch linux is an advance linux distribution because of its minimal nature of it. The good news is that Arch Linux installs faster than Debian from my experience. 
        The bad news is that programs will break and you will have to figure out how to fix them in Arch Linux. I reccomend you look at the lastest news section of Arch Linux website 
        (https://archlinux.org/).

      <h2> Reccomendations </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Have some experience with --> Ubuntu or --> Manjaro </li>
      
      <li> Learn to use the terminal in linux. This will likely take some time to master it if you are not used to with it. 
        When I started Arch Linux I had rusty terminal skills. </li>
      
      <li> Install it on virtual machine with a program called virtualbox. 
        This would give you practice to install Arch Linux on hardware. </li>
    </ul>
